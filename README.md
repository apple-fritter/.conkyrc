A Conky configuration (".conkyrc") file generates a system monitoring output that displays various information related to the computer's hardware, system processes, and network activity.

The output is displayed on the desktop and includes information such as the system name, kernel version, uptime, CPU usage, memory usage, storage usage, top processes by memory usage, and network activity for Ethernet, WiFi, and USB tethering if available.

The display is aligned to the top right corner of the screen and includes graphical elements such as a battery bar, memory bar, and file system bars for root and swap partitions. The display is also transparent and has an opacity value of 145.

Window/display declarations: The own_window declarations define the window properties, such as the type of window, transparency, and positioning. The double_buffer setting enables smooth animation and eliminates flickering.

Text/decoration: The use_xft declaration enables Conky to use TrueType fonts, while xftfont defines the font and size used in the output.

The alignment setting determines the position of the Conky display on the screen, and the gap_x and gap_y settings define the horizontal and vertical spacing between the Conky display and the screen edge.

System information: The SYSTEM and Uptime declarations display the system name, kernel version, and uptime. The Battery declaration displays a battery status bar.

CPU information: The CPU Cores declaration displays a horizontal bar graph for each CPU core, indicating CPU usage.

Memory information: The RAM declaration displays memory usage as a bar graph.

Storage information: The STORAGE declaration displays storage usage for the root partition and swap partition as bar graphs.

Top processes: The TOP PROCESSES declaration displays the top five processes consuming memory.

Network information: The NETWORK declaration displays network activity for Ethernet, WiFi, and USB tethering if available. It includes the upload and download speeds and total upload and download data transfer. The if_existing statements check for the existence of the network interfaces before displaying their status.
